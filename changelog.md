# Changelog

## 0.1.3.0

- Apply EXIF rotation to JPEG images
- Correctly scale the image and marked corners when resizing the window
- Display helpful error message when wrong file format is dropped
- Support installing with `brew cask`
- Use latest version of ImageMagick


## 0.1.2.0

- ImageMagick is now embedded in the bundle
    and doesn't need to be installed globally anymore. ðŸŽ‰


## 0.1.1.0

This is basically a MVP release.
I've used it to correct hundreds of images,
so it works and is already quite useful, but there are a few limitations:

- ImageMagick is not bundled and must therefore be installed globally
- Due to a [render bug of gloss] the initial view is a little broken
    and one needs to rescale the window to force a redraw
